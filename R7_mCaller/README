This program is designed to call m6A from nanopore data using the differences between measured and expected currents for R7 nanopore data. Not going to develop this further, but here is the code anyway. 

REQUIREMENTS:
# python packages
- scikit-learn 
- h5py
- biopython 
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- pysam
- scipy
- pandas

# other
- nanopore sequencing data (fast5 format)
- a bam file with the alignment of the nanopore sequences to a reference genome, sorted and indexed (try graphmap, samtools view -bS, samtools sort, samtools index)
- a reference sequence file (fasta)

OPTIONS:
usage: mCaller_nanopolish.py [-h] (-p POSITIONS | -m) -r REFERENCE -f TSV
                             [-t THREADS] [-l LABEL] [-b BASE] [--train] [-v]

-p/--positions [position file]	provide a list of positions at which to classify (default)
-m/--motifs [SEQUENCE]		sequence of motifs to classify (eg. GATC)
-w/--whole-genome 		classify at every adenine in a genome
-r/--reference [ref fasta]	file with the reference sequence aligned to 
-f/--tsv [bam file]		file with alignment from nanopolish
-t/--threads [int]		not implemented yet - ignore this option, your choices are 1 or 1
-l/--label [string]		label your bases at list of positions (for training)
-b/--base [A or C]		base to call as methylated or unmethylated
--train				not currently in use - ignore this option
-h/--help			print help
-v/--version			print version
