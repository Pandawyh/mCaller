This program is designed to call m6A from nanopore data using the differences between measured and expected currents. 

REQUIREMENTS:
# python packages
- scikit-learn 
- h5py
- biopython 
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- pysam
- scipy
- pandas

# other
- nanopore sequencing data (fast5 format)
- a bam file with the alignment of the nanopore sequences to a reference genome, sorted and indexed (try graphmap, samtools view -bS, samtools sort, samtools index)
- a reference sequence file (fasta)

OPTIONS:
-p/--positions [position file]	provide a list of positions at which to classify (default)
-w/--whole-genome 		classify at every adenine in a genome
-r/--reference [ref fasta]	file with the reference sequence aligned to 
-b/--bam [bam file]		file with alignment **must be sorted and indexed
-h/--help			print help
-v/--version			print version
