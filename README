This program is designed to call m6A from nanopore data using the differences between measured and expected currents. 

REQUIREMENTS:
# python packages
- scikit-learn 
- h5py
- biopython 
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- pysam
- scipy
- pandas

# other
- nanopore sequencing data (fast5 format)
- a bam file with the alignment of the nanopore sequences to a reference genome, sorted and indexed (try graphmap, samtools view -bS, samtools sort, samtools index)
- a reference sequence file (fasta)

OPTIONS:

usage: mCaller_nanopolish.py [-h] (-p POSITIONS | -m) -r REFERENCE -f TSV
                             [-t THREADS] [-l LABEL] [-b BASE] [--train] [-v]

-p/--positions [position file]	provide a list of positions at which to classify (default)
-m/--motif [nucleobases]	classify at each instance of a particular motif >= 1 base long (eg. A or GATC) in a genome
-r/--reference [ref fasta]	file with the reference sequence aligned to 
-f/--tsv [tsv file]		file with signal realignment from nanopolish
-t/--threads [int]		no function, currently, options are 1 or 1
-l/--label [eg. m6A]		label defined positions for training
-b/--base [A or C]		base to classify as methylated or unmethylated 
--train				no current function
-h/--help			print help
-v/--version			print version
